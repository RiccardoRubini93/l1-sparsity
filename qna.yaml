      - question: |
          What method is used to sparsify energy interactions in Galerkin models?
        answer: |
          The method used is l1-regularized regression, specifically LASSO, to identify and prune weak triadic
          interactions.
      - question: |
          What flow configuration is studied in the paper?
        answer: |
          The study focuses on two-dimensional unsteady lid-driven cavity flow at a Reynolds number of 20,000.
      - question: |
          What is the primary goal of sparsifying Galerkin models?
        answer: |
          The goal is to produce sparse, interpretable models that accurately capture the flow dynamics with reduced
          computational cost.
      - question: |
          How much of the triadic interactions can be removed without significant accuracy loss?
        answer: |
          Up to 80% of triadic interactions can be pruned without major loss in model accuracy.
      - question: |
          Does the sparsified model maintain stability and energy conservation?
        answer: |
          Yes, sparsified models exhibit excellent long-term stability and approximate energy conservation.
      - question: |
          How does the choice of modal basis affect sparsity?
        answer: |
          The choice between POD and DFT modes impacts both the sparsity and structure of the dominant interactions
          identified.
